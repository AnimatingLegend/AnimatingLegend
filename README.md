# Hey, I'm Aaron Augustin 👋🏽
I'm a **Junior Developer** interested in coding, problem-solving, and web development.
I have an expertise in **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) + [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [Javascript](), [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react), & [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe)**.
Additionally, I have a creative side, and occasionally dabble in **2D Animation** using **[Adobe Animate](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.html)**. Through my work, I have developed skills in software developemnt, frontend / backend programming, and API integrations. I enjoy solving challenges, developing my coding skills further, and creating innovative solutions. My goal is to continue growing as a developer & animator and produce effective, well-designed digital experiences.
